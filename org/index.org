* About

I'm a computer programmer based in Leeds in the UK. The best way to
contact me is to send an email to [[mailto:horsfallp@gmail.com][horsfallp@gmail.com]].

I'm currently available for hire. My [[file:bio.org][bio]] gives an overview of my
skills and recent experience. Please feel free to get in touch if you
have a project (of any kind!) you think I might be able to help with,
I'd be happy to chat.
